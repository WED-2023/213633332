        <div>
        <h2><u>Question 1</u></h2>
        <p>
            <u>Web 1.0</u> is the first version of a website in the World Wide Web evolution.
            <br>
            The majority of the users were consumers of content.
            <br>
            Most of the pages were static, mean you can't change them, only rea information from them.
            <br>
            There were a lot of personal web pages.
            <br>
            They were hosted on ISP-run web servers, or free web hosting services. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Web 2.0</u> is the stage when websites started to highlight user generated content.
            <br>
            In this stage entered into the world many social media platforms like Facebook.
            <br>
            In contrast to Web 1.0 pages which were static, Web 2.0 pages were interactive. 
            <br>
            Users can click on things and change how the website looks. Therefore, people could put like and share and those 
            <br> 
            applications made social media websites works.
            <br>
            We can say that Web 2.0 is a better version of Web 1.0.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Web 3.0</u>  is the stage when website start using Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning
            <br>
            In contrast to Web 2.0 which has been mainly about front end user experience, Web 3.0 Focuses more about the back end.
            <br>
            In Web 3.0 the Web was start to acting like a huge database.
            <br>
            Web 3.0 also features the Semantic Web. 
            <br>
            The semantic web means an improve way of searching in the web, what lead to better results from search engines.
            <br>
            In the Semantic Web we could make an analysis based on the capability to comprehend the meaning of words, rather than on keywords or numbers.
            <br>
            For example, saving words as vectors instead as words themselves in order to make words with similar meaning a close distance between each vector
        </p>

        <h2><u>Question 2</u></h2>
        <p>

          One difference between web 1, web 3 can be explained through a use case :
          <br>
          For example, imagine we search for "side effect of a new medicine"
          <br>
          If we search this in web 1, we would get a static page about many other drugs, and we would have to extract from there by
          ourselves information about the specific medicine we want.
          <br>
          In web 2, we can use a search engine that gives as relevant document based on the words we used in the query.
          We can also look up for active forums online and ask people about it, and they can provide us an answer.
          <br>
          In web 3, thourgh use of a the semantic web, we could get a page that can give us better results for the medicine that we
          looked for, and this could be a page dedicated only to this specific medicine.
          <br> we might even get a page of the company that produced this medicine and we could extract the information from There
          and not from a random page in wikipedia.
          <br> This is because through semantic web we can find similar words in meaning to the medicine we looked for, because of 
          the words' vectors that this web represents.

          <br>
          <br>

          Another difference we could see between web 1 and web 2 and web 3 if we try to open a page for some social media, lets take
          facebook for example.
          <br>
          If I would have opened a page of facebook in web 1 I would get a static page of a user, without the ability to comment,
          share, or like/dislike any image or video that I would see there.
          <br> In contrast, in web 2 the page would be dynamic, and I could do all the previous actions I have mentioned before
          and it would be much more joyful and addictive.
          <br> In Web 3 we would also have machine learning algorithms that can find what topics the user is interested in and
          can try to guess new topics that he would be interested in based on different users with similar activity.
