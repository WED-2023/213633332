        <div>
        <h2><u>Question 1</u></h2>
        <p>
            <u>Web 1.0</u> is the first version of a website in the World Wide Web evolution.
            <br>
            The majority of the users were consumers of content.
            <br>
            Most of the pages were static, mean you can't change them, only rea information from them.
            <br>
            There were a lot of personal web pages.
            <br>
            They were hosted on ISP-run web servers, or free web hosting services. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Web 2.0</u> is the stage when websites started to highlight user generated content.
            <br>
            In this stage entered into the world many social media platforms like Facebook.
            <br>
            In contrast to Web 1.0 pages which were static, Web 2.0 pages were interactive. 
            <br>
            Users can click on things and change how the website looks. Therefore, people could put like and share and those 
            <br> 
            applications made social media websites works.
            <br>
            We can say that Web 2.0 is a better version of Web 1.0.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Web 3.0</u>  is the stage when website start using Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning
            <br>
            In contrast to Web 2.0 which has been mainly about front end user experience, Web 3.0 Focuses more about the back end.
            <br>
            In Web 3.0 the Web was start to acting like a huge database.
            <br>
            Web 3.0 also features the Semantic Web. 
            <br>
            The semantic web means an improve way of searching in the web, what lead to better results from search engines.
            <br>
            In the Semantic Web we could make an analysis based on the capability to comprehend the meaning of words, rather than on keywords or numbers.
            <br>
            For example, saving words as vectors instead as words themselves in order to make words with similar meaning a close distance between each vector
