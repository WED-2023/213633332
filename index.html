        <div>
        <h2><u>Question 1</u></h2>
        <p>
            <u>Web 1.0</u> is the first version of a website in the World Wide Web evolution.
            <br>
            The majority of the users were consumers of content.
            <br>
            Most of the pages were static, mean you can't change them, only rea information from them.
            <br>
            There were a lot of personal web pages.
            <br>
            They were hosted on ISP-run web servers, or free web hosting services. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Web 2.0</u> is the stage when websites started to highlight user generated content.
            <br>
            In this stage entered into the world many social media platforms like Facebook.
            <br>
            In contrast to Web 1.0 pages which were static, Web 2.0 pages were interactive. 
            <br>
            Users can click on things and change how the website looks. Therefore, people could put like and share and those 
            <br> 
            applications made social media websites works.
            <br>
            We can say that Web 2.0 is a better version of Web 1.0.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Web 3.0</u>  is the stage when website start using Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning
            <br>
            In contrast to Web 2.0 which has been mainly about front end user experience, Web 3.0 Focuses more about the back end.
            <br>
            In Web 3.0 the Web was start to acting like a huge database.
            <br>
            Web 3.0 also features the Semantic Web. 
            <br>
            The semantic web means an improve way of searching in the web, what lead to better results from search engines.
            <br>
            In the Semantic Web we could make an analysis based on the capability to comprehend the meaning of words, rather than on keywords or numbers.
            <br>
            For example, saving words as vectors instead as words themselves in order to make words with similar meaning a close distance between each vector
        </p>

        <h2><u>Question 2</u></h2>
        <p>

          One difference between web 1, web 3 can be explained through a use case :
          <br>
          For example, imagine we search for "side effect of a new medicine"
          <br>
          If we search this in web 1, we would get a static page about many other drugs, and we would have to extract from there by
          ourselves information about the specific medicine we want.
          <br>
          In web 3, thourgh use of a the semantic web, we could get a page that can give us better results for the medicine that we
          looked for, and this could be a page dedicated only to this specific medicine.
          <br> we might even get a page of the company that produced this medicine and we could extract the information from There
          and not from a random page in wikipedia.
          <br> This is because through semantic web we can find similar words in meaning to the medicine we looked for, because of 
          the words' vectors that this web represents.

          <br>
          <br>

          Another difference we could see between web 1 and web 2 if we try to open a page for some social media, lets take
          facebook for example.
          <br>
          If I would have opened a page of facebook in web 1 I would get a static page of a user, without the ability to comment,
          share, or like/dislike any image or video that I would see there.
          <br> In contrast, in web 2 the page would be dynamic, and I could do all the previous actions I have mentioned before
          and it would be much more joyful and addictive.
